Most important enhancements
===========================

- Add new selenium 4 print page as PDF functionality (`#1824`_)
  The print page as pdf functionality within Selenium 4 has been added into SeleniumLibrary
  with a new keyword. See the keyword documentation for usage.
- Add driver Service Class into Open Browser (`#1900`_)
  Selenium has shifted from a couple arguments for configuring the driver settings into the new
  Service class. As with the options argument these changes allows for service class to be set
  using a simlar string format. More information can be found in the `Open Browser` keyword
  documentation and newly rearranged Introduction.
- Add warning about frame deselection when using `Page Should Contain` keyword. (`#1894`_)
  In searching through the page, the `Page Should Contain` keyword will select and search
  through frames. Thus it silently changes the frame context. Added warning within the keyword
  documentation noting as such.
- Wrong Type Hint on some keywords. (`locator: Union[WebElement, None, str]`) (`#1880`_)
  Several type hints on locator arguments denoted the argument allowed for none when indeed
  they did not. This corrects those type hints.

Deprecated features
===================

- Start Deprecation and Removal of Selenium2Library (deep) references/package (`#1826`_)
  Removed references and instructions regarding Selenium2Library; moving some to an archived
  VERSIONS.rst top level documentation.
